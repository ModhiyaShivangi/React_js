        <h2>Q. -What are Uncontrolled Components ?</h2>
        In React, an 'input type="text" ' is always an uncontrolled component because its value can only be set by a user, and not programmatically.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Q.- What are Controlled components ?</h2>
        In React, controlled components refer to components that have their state and behavior controlled by the parent component. These components rely on props passed down from the parent component to update their state and behavior.
        
        <h2 className='mt-3'>Q.- What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled
        Components in React ?</h2>
        <p><b>In a controlled component, the value of the form elements is controlled by
        React. The component's state is used to manage the value, and any
        changes to the value are handled by updating the state. In an
        uncontrolled component, the value of the form elements is managed by
        the DOM itself, and React doesn't control or track the value.</b></p>
